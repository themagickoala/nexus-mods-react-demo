# NexusMods React demo repo

This repository is designed to be used as an interview exercise for applicants to the NexusMods front-end team.

## How to get started

You should fork this repository, or create a new repository based on the source code contained here. Once that's done, you should spend some time reading through the source code and familiarising yourself with it.

## The task

We'd like you to try and write some tests for the code contained here. This can take one of the following forms:

- You can add tests to your repo and share the link with your interviewer;
- You can add a testing.md file explaining your thought process and how you'd approach testing this code;
- You can have a think about how you would approach this task and be prepared to discuss it at interview.

Once you've forked the repo is yours to edit, so feel free to add packages, edit source code if you need to, etc.

## The interview

At your interview, we'll chat about the task and share ideas for what could be done. We'll also ask if you have any other suggestions for how you would go about improving this codebase. You can do as much or as little of the task as you like, but please don't spend more than 2-3 hours working on this - your time is precious!
